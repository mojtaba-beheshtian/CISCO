################################
static routing
################################
connected subnet has been learnt automatically with the 'C' pointer (directly connected).
in the static routing, all the records should be add to the routers routing table manually and will be shown with the 'S' pointer (static).
	
	router(config)#ip route <network id> <mask> <out-interface> | <next-hop-ip-address>
	router#show ip route

NOTE: if a static route fails, it will remove from the routing table.

Default route:
	router(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <out-interface> | <next-hop-ip-address>

NOTE:if a destination ip address in a packet matches with more that a record in the routing table, it will be forwarded through the router witch has the higher mask number or more specific subnet mask.

################################
manual summarization
################################
problems: suboptimal routing
	* packets will route to destinations that not exists instead of being discard.
	* packets with unknown destination will lead to default route.

solution:Null 0
	* in the router which we have manually summarized routes, we add a static route for the exact manually summarized network to Null 0.
	
################################
dynamic routing
################################
1- dynamically update routing tabes.
2- dynamically best path election.
3- dynamically route elimination in case of failing a path.
4- adding another path (if exists) incase of failing a route.
