spanning tree protocol
################################
redundant links may be a very good idea.but they may have lots of troubles too:
$ switching loop
$ broadcast storm
$ multiple frames copies

why dont we have routing loops in other words, why is redundant links allowed between routers?

################################
standard stp
################################
IEEE 802.1D
& stp is a layer 2 protocol for a loop free network.
& avoiding switching loops by disabling redundant links.
& by this we may have link redundancy in ethernet networks.

################################
how stp works
################################
% one switch becomes the center point. 
% that switch starts to meet other switches following the link.
% each link that switch has not passed to reach other switches are not necessary and should be killed.

NOTE: stp is enable and active by default.
NOTE: stp does not concern trunk or access links.
NOTE: central point is important because it is the concentration of traffic.

when you turn a switch on every port on that switch becomes blocked.unless:
	1-designated ports on the root bridge: one switch becomes root bridge and all of its ports enables forwarding.
	2-root ports on the other switches: each switch has a port that is the nearest port to the root bridge.we call that port, root port and it is enable and forward
	3-designated ports on the other switches: on each segment (collision domain), there is a switch near to the root bridge, we call that switch "Designated bridge" the port on regarding to the designated bridge is the designated port on that segment.

################################
root bridge selection
################################
every switch (with stp enable on it) pretend to be root bridge as soon as it turns on.
in oder to prove that claim, it Multicast Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) packets.this packets send every 2sec.
there are two kinds of BPDU:
	# Hello BPDU
	# TCN
claimant switch send Hello BPDUs and put its name in the Root Bridge Field.
so every switch in that network introduce it self as the root bridges and contnu making & sending BPDUs until it receive a better BPDU.
then it stop making its own BPDU and just forwards the better BPDU.
as there is only one best BPDU in the network, after a while all the switches make an agreement about the root bridge.

better BPDU is a BPDU with the LOWER Root Bridge (bridg ID)
in oher words:
a switch with a lower priority will be the root bridge if priorites are th same , a switch with lower MAC address will be the root bridge.

for select a switch for root bridge you must consider 2 parameter:
	1- lower bridge id
	2- path cost

################################
bridge ID
################################
every switch in stp has a bridge ID.

bridge id:
	stp priority:switch MAC address 
EXAMPLE:	
	(32768:2234.f21c.2154.0017)

NOTE: by default the priority is 32768

BPDU main fields:
	@ root bridge (bridge id)
	@ sender bridge (bridge id)
	@ cost to reach root bridge

################################
path cost
################################
each switch edit the sender and cost field befor forwarding the root bridges BPDU.
it adds the cost of the receiving link to the cost field.

		#############################	
		# Data rate # STP IEEE cost #
		#############################
		# 4 Mbps    # 250	    #
		# 10 Mbps   # 100	    #
		# 16 Mbps   # 62	    #
		# 100 Mbps  # 19 	    #
		# 1 Gbps    # 4	 	    #
		# 2 Gbps    # 3		    #
		# 10Gbps    # 2		    #
		#############################

################################
Root port
################################
switch may receive BPDU on more than its one ports. 
root port is the port that has received the lowest cost BPDU to the root bridge in each switch.

################################
Designated port
################################
on each segment on the network rhe switch that sends the BPDU with the lower cost is the Designated bridge.
so Designated port is the port that sends the lowest cost BPDU to the root bridge in eachsegment.

NOTE:if the cost of two switch to root bridge is the same, for select the designated port you must:
	1- lower sender bridge ID
	2- lower port ID

################################
configuration
################################
Root Bridge election
	sw(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096   #lower than 32768 and multiple of 4096	
or	
	sw(config)#no spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
	sw(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 root priority	#32768-(2*4096)= 24576 priprity
	sw#show spanning-tree
	sw(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondry   #32768-4096= 28672 priprity

################################
stp durations
################################
Hello time:
	root bridge generate BPDU and advertises it.(2sec)

Max age:
	if a switch does not reveive expected BPDU or receives a worse BPDU, it consider a change in the network and react.
	(10 times of the hello time= 20 sec)

Forward delay:
	when the switch becomes confident that a change has occurred, it converges with the new situation.
	some block ports may become forwarding but there are some levels.
		block -> listening -> learning -> forwarding
		     (forward delay) (forward delay)
			(15 sec)	(15 sec)

################################
network topology change
################################
	@ link election
	@ root bridge climination
	@ link addition
	@ root bridge addition

1- direct topology change:
	switch does not wait for the max age.it just 2 forward delays (30 sec).
2- indirect topology change:
	switch does not receive BPDU expect or worse BPDU is being received.switch wait for the max age.
		max age (20 sec) + 2 forward delays (30 sec) = 50 sec
3- insignificant topology change:
	each pc in a networks can change a switch port to up and down by getting turned on or off.so switche may think of a direct topology change.
	but we know this change may not caus loops. so there is no need for the switch to do anything.
	
by enabling PORT FAST on accesss ports we tell the switch:
	$do not generate TCN when an access port goes up and down.
	$do not go to convergance process (30 sec) when an access port goes up and down and immediately turn a block port into a forwarding port.

port fast configuration:
	sw(config-if)#spanning-tree port-fast

so what happen if you accidentally attach a switch to a port fast enabled port? it can cause loops !!!

################################
BPDU guard
################################
by this feature we tell the switch that if you receive BPDUs on an access link with port-fast enabled, it means that this port is attached to a switch.
this port goes to "error-disabled" mode and shuts down.
        sw(config-if)#spanning-tree bpdu-guard enable

so on all access ports we will do:
        sw(config-if)#spanning-tree port-fast
        sw(config-if)#spanning-tree bpdu-guard enable

####################################
TCN (topology change notification)
####################################
when a port gets up or down, switch sends a TCN BPDU on its root port.
next switch (which has received that TCN) again forwards that TCN on its root port, until it reach the root bridge.
then root bridge generate a Hello BPDU (with the TCN flag sets to 1) and sends it to all the switches.
so every one has noticed the change in the topology.
in this time every switch that has received this configuration BPDU reduce its MAC table age time from 5 min to 15 sec.
it means in this switch will eliminate a record in the MAC table if it doesnt get any update in 15 sec.
if it updates it change the age time back to 5 min.

################################
different types of stp
################################
1- stp traditional (IEEE 802.D)
problems:
	$ long convergence time
	$ its not possible to use all the links.
solution:
	1- cisco PVST (per vlan stp)
		* its possible to use all the links.
		* some thing like load balancing.
		* problem: it just work with ISL (not IEEE.1Q)
		* problem: its not compatible with IEEE 802.D
	
	2- cisco PVST+
		* it has resolved PVST problems.
		* all the cisco switches uses this version by default.
		* problem: long convergence time
	
	3- IEEE 802.1W (RSTP)
		* to reduce convergence time.
	
	4- cisco RPVST+
		* load balancing and convergence time reduction.
		* problem: there will be a fresh instance of stp for each vlan (low performance)
	
	5- IEEE 802.1S (MST)
		* multiple stp
		* using just one instance of stp (higher performance)
		* using RSTP (convergence time reduction)
		* manual management
