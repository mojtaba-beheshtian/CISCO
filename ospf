link state & distance vector
#####################################
distance vector:
	each router advertises its entire routing table to its only neighbor routers periodically.
	in the distance vector protocols each router was just aware of its neighbors.

link state:
	each router advertises its connected links information to all the routers in the network (AS) just one time.
	in the link state protocol each router has an overview of the total networks topology.

#####################################
OSPF (open shortest path first)
#####################################
ospf protocol and operation
	1-ospf neighbor ship
	2-ospf topology database exchange
	3-building ip routing table

configuring ospf
	%scaling ospf through hierarchical design

	ospf neighbor table > ospf topology table > routing table

#####################################
ospf neighbor ship
#####################################
each router first get to know its neighbor routers and keeps the information of them in the ospf neighbor table

purpose:
%to make sure that neighbor routers are alive.
%ospf parameters compatibility check in two neighbor routers.

periodically sent in HELLO TIMES each "10sec".
default DEAD TIME is "40sec".

when dead time expires:
$all the routes of that router will be eliminated.
$ospf topology database will be updated.
$ospf neighbor table will be updated.

NOTE:	RIP seats on UDP
	OSPF seats on IP

NOTE:ospf protocol is work on  destination ip address MULTICAST "224.0.0.5"

in ospf hello packets there are some parameters that in case of not being compatible, neighbor ship will not occur:
	%subnet number
	%subnet mask
	%hello interval
	%dead interval
	%Area ID
	%authentication key
	%value of stub area flag 

neighbor ship phases:
1-Down:
	 router starts sending hellos to "224.0.0.5" but has not received any.

2-Initialized:
	 router has just received a hello packet with the destination ip address of "224.0.0.5"

3-To way:
	 router UNICAST a hello packet in the answer of the received hello.it adds the address of the router which has been received the hello befor, in the neighbor list field.
	it means:	
	$ ospf parameters are compatible
	$ router has received a hello packet from a neighbor which its name is in the packet.

4-Database exchange process: 
	in the point-to-point networks
	in the multi-access networks

5-Full:
	database of two neighbors router are the same.

#####################################
router ID
##################################### 
each router has a 32bit identifier in ospf
1st:
	router ID command in the ospf configuration mode
2st:
	greatest loopback interface ip address
3st:
	greatest up interface ip address

NOTE:router ID election is none-preemptive, to change you must clear ip ospf proccess.

#####################################
ospf packets
#####################################
1- Hello , T1

2- DBD (database description), T2
	when two routers are in the Two-way state, each router sends DBD to its neighbor. DBD is summery information of the routers database.

3- LSR (link state request), T3
	after each router receives a DBD, it checks for the information that it has not been informed befor and its database lacks, then sends a LSR for those details link information.

4- LSU (link state update), T4
	after receiving the LSR, it send the detailed information in the form of a LSU. LSU contains some LSAs (link state advertisment)

5- ACK, T5
	LSA transmit ion is reliable in link state protocol (in distance vector is unreliable). when a router receives a LSU it confirms with an ACK.

#####################################
designated router (DR)
#####################################
it use in the multi access networks, one router will become the designated router (DR).
every other router will exchange their topology databases just with the DR, so the processes will fall to (n-1).
DR is responsible for syncing all the other routers.
DR is a single point of failure. so there will be a backup designated router (BDR) too.
BDR permanently checks the DR to make sure its alive, until then BDR will do nothing but when DR fails, BDR replaces.

NOTE: DR & BDR addressnwill be advertised through hello packets.

DR & BDR election in ospf:
	$ the router which has the higher ospf priority will be the DR
		r1(config)#interface fastethernet 0/0
		r1(config-if)#ip ospf priority 10
	$ higher router ID will use as the tie breaker in case of equal periorites.
	$ the second best router will be BDR.
	$ priority of 0 will not become DR or BDR
	$ priority will be in rangeof 0 to 255
	$ DR & BDR election is non preemptive.

#####################################
routing table
#####################################
each router (after its full states, topology database completion), run SPF algorithm (Dijikstra) to calculate the shortest path to each network.
this shortest path will be placed into the routing table.
shortest path will be determined based on metric.

#####################################
ospf metric

ospf metric: total links costs.
cost = (100 Mbps) / (link bandwidth in Mbps)
